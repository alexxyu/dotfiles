# dotfiles-nix

An experimental dotfiles setup using [nix](https://nixos.org) and
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). So far, this has only been tested in a
NixOS-arm64 VM running on a M1 MacBook host and is a relatively minimal setup that is a direct
conversion of my [original dotfiles](https://github.com/alexxyu/dotfiles).

I'm still learning how to use nix, and we'll see if I can start using nix in my existing machines.
